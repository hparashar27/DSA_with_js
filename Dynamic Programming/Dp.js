DP - Optimal solution + Overlapping subproblems

OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE -> A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems

OVERLAPPING SUBPROBLEMS -> A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times

for example if we talk about the fibbncaci series then when we solve it with recurssion then its time complexity is of (2^n)
