WHAT IS A HASH TABLE?
Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs.

They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.

Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing values!

THE HASH PART

To implement a hash table, we'll be using an array.In order to look up values by key, we need a way to convert keys into valid array indices.A function that performs this task is called a hash function.

Dealing with Collisions
Even with a large array and a great hash function, collisions are inevitable. 

There are many strategies for dealing with collisions, but we'll focus on two:

Separate Chaining
Linear Probing
