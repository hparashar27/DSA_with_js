// Acording to this javascript course there are two ways of traversing the tree ->

// Breadth first search ->
// In this type of tree traversal, traverse the tree by level by level
/*
the algo for the BST iteratively ->

1 - Create a Queue (using an array as well) and variable to store the value of the visited node
2 - Place the root node in the queue, Loop untill the queue get ended 
3 - Dequeue a node from the queue and push the value of node into the variable that store the node
4- if there is a left property on the node dequeued add it to queue
5 - if there is a right property on the node dequeued add it to the queue
6- return the variable that stores the value  

*/

// Depth First search -> In this type of traversal three types of the traversal comes 
// DEPTH PREORDER TRAVERSAL 
// DEPTH INORDER TRAVERSAL 
// DEPTH POSTORDER TRAVERSAL
